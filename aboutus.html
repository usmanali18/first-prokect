                      <p class="card-text">Who doesn't love the gorgeous glamour of gold jewellery? Its beautiful quality and colour make it the most sought after metal when it comes to jewellery. That said, even gold jewellery won't do much for you if you don't consider how to style it. When styling jewellery, some people make the mistake of overdoing it without panache, leaving them looking overdone - and not in a good way. Others may be too subdued and draw little if any attention to their jewellery choices. There are also those who wear the same pieces day in and day out, some of which may be lovely but they get lost in repetition (and I bet they need a good clean too!).<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">When it comes to wearing gold jewellery especially, you'll really want to make the most of your investment and style it so you look your best when wearing it - and so that you
                                     show it off appropriately.
                         Here is our best guide to styling different types of gold jewellery. Let's dive in ...
                         CHOOSE YOUR MAIN PIECE OF JEWELLERY
                        When it comes to jewellery, you'll often want to create a focal point. In other words, you will want to find a specific area that you want others to be drawn to when they look at you. Consciously or not, this is a way of communicating something about yourself to other people, so it pays to spend some time thinking about it.

                      <p class="card-text">Like so many other products, jewellery sales are increasingly moving online rather than taking place in a traditional brick and mortar store. Shopping online is of course quick and convenient, plus it allows you to shop from places far away from your location.
                        While being able to see a piece of jewellery and trying it on in person is great, the downside is the inconvenience of needing to travel to a store and being limited to what that particular store has available. You'll also miss out on beautiful artisan jewellery created by independent designers who generally don't have bricks and mortar stores (like us!).
                        While there are plenty of upsides to shopping for jewellery online, it still takes some consideration and there are a number of ways it can go wrong. In order to buy jewellery you'll love you need to pay attention to the right things and avoid some of the pitfalls.
                        If you avoid our top 7 Online Jewellery Shopping Mistakes, you'll be much more likely to have a positive experience and will enjoy wearing your beautiful new pieces for years to come.</p>

                      <p class="card-text"><b>  Have you ever questioned the authenticity of the diamonds set within your precious jewellery item?</b> <br>
                        We don’t claim to be Diamond experts or valuers but we are amazed at how seemingly ‘simple’ it appears, to check if a diamond is fake. The video below outlines 8 very simple tests which can be completed at home to check the authenticity of your diamonds.
                        Can we take this seriously? and is there any truth to these home tests? So while you go dig out your diamond rings that auntie Pat left you in her Will, please note the information below is a guide only and should be taken with caution. If you are in any doubt about the authenticity of diamonds you have bought or been given please seek the opinion of a professional valuer or Jeweller.
                       <br> <b>  Electronic Diamond Tester </b>
                        The simplest and most accurate way of checking the authenticity of your diamond is to purchase a Diamond Tester from amazon. These inexpensive devices can tell you a lot about the properties of your stone.
                        <br><b> The weighing test </b>
                        Using a carat or gram scale you can check the weight of your diamond. Fake diamonds will normally weigh 50 – 60% heavier than an authentic diamond of the same size.

                      <h2 class="card-title" style="color: burlywood;">DOES THE COLOUR OF WHITE GOLD AND SILVER CHANGE?  </h2>
                      <p class="card-text">As you’ve seen, natural gold as its mined has a rich yellow colour.
                      To get this colour to a shade of white/silver a concoction of metals including silver, copper and palladium are alloyed in. 
                      As you can imagine, the yellow undertone can’t be overpowered completely, and the end result is not as white as you’d wish it to be.  
                      To counter this jewellers plate white gold with a few microns of rhodium to improve the “whiteness” and sheen of a jewellery piece. 
                      Rhodium is stunning, but disappointingly the plating starts wearing off in a few short months. Even if you were expecting this, you don’t want this gradual degradation in colour to be your focus when looking at your white gold engagement ring. And it is going to bug you, I promise. 
                      Take a look at the stark difference in white gold colour of unplated white gold on the left, and a fresh rhodium plating on the right
                      I’m unaware of jewellers that offer free rhodium plating for the life of the ring. Prices range from around R200 – R500 ($30+) and will be needed every 6 months to a year to keep a white gold engagement ring ring in tip-top shape. 
                      Silver are naturally a beautiful shade of white silver and don’t need any form of plating. Fifty years on, and the metal will still appear as white as the first day you laid eyes on the ring.
